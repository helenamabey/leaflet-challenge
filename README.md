# leaflet-challenge

- Used https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/193161/add-legend-to-leaflet-map to assist with creating the legend, fellow student David Rodgers suggested the site for assistance.
- Opted for just part 1 as required in the challenge
- My Git-Page only deploys the README file. I did not want to move the part 2 subfile as the instructions call out creating this folder. My page does launch at https://helenamabey.github.io/leaflet-challenge/Leaflet-Part-1/ correctly with no errors.
